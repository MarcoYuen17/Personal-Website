                    I am enthusiastic about eventually learning cybersecurity as well as artificial intelligence / machine learning. I aspire to apply these concepts in a healthcare setting.
                    Currently, I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am excited to learn and create a project with Python soon.
