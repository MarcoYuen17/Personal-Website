                            I am enthusiastic about eventually learning cybersecurity as well as artificial intelligence / machine learning, aspiring to apply these concepts in a healthcare setting.
                            Currently, I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I am eager to learn and create a project with Python in the near future.

                        <p>
                            Lifelong learning is a commitment of mine, a commitment that I believe is crucial to worldwide camaraderie as well as the advancement of our civilization. <!--TODO: split p?-->

                        <p>
                            When not working, my hobbies include hiking, running, swimming, baking, cooking, and snowboarding. 
                            I cherish spending time outdoors because it provides opportunities to appreciate and connect with nature.
                            At home, baking and cooking in various different cuisines exposes me to a variety of cultures. 
                            Through participating in these hobbies, I often come across or create something exciting which, by sharing, can help to enlighten the lives of my friends and family.
